# CNN Image Classification with PyTorch

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using PyTorch. The model is trained and evaluated on a labeled image dataset, with performance metrics reported for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Features

- Custom CNN architecture  
- Train/test dataset splitting  
- Data preprocessing and augmentation  
- Evaluation with confusion matrix and classification report  
- Modular helper functions  
- Progress tracking with `tqdm`

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SappyProduct/CNN-ImageClassif.git
   cd CNN-ImageClassif
   ```

2. **Activate your virtual environment and install requirements**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Launch the notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook CNN_ImgClassif.ipynb
   ```
